# Added

* Input argument qlot-no-deps was added.

  Make Qlot ignore asd files and their dependencies.

  This this might be useful in rare cases when your project contains a non-readable asd files such as templates.")

# Fixed

* Extended test matrix with macos-14 runner.
* Fixed Roswell cache paths for macos-14 runner.
* Extended qlot cache key with runner architecture.

* Cache key was extended with runner architecture. Thanks for the contribution to √Åkos Kiss!

         "
# Fixed

* There was an error when action suceeded, but actually failed trying to load my quicklisp fix for package inferred systems.
  A code to load this fix used :HOME as a pathname component which is not supported by some CL implementations. Actually,
  I've already fixed this issue in 3.1.0 version, but somehow this fix was lost. Also, a handler-bind wrapper around the loader was added
  and now action's tests will fail in case of any errors.

# Fixed

* Fix recreating of qlfile inside qlot environment cache.

  When some jobs used qlfile-template argument + caching, a template application
  result was cached and caused an error during the next run.
")
  (4.0.1 2024-02-25
         "
# Fixed

* Fixed loading of quicklisp-osx-fix. Previously the script made unnecessary output and when you had a `qlfile` template in your workflow this output leaked into `qlfile` broking following `qlot install`.
")
  (4.0.0 2024-02-24
         "
# Changed

* Internal cache mechanism was added. Now action caches Roswell and Qlot files to speed up reruns. For example, without cache action could be executed about 4 minutes, and with cache it runs only 20 seconds on Ubuntu or 1 minute on Windows.
* A new input variable `cache` was added to control caching beheviour. It is `true` by default, but you can switch it to `false` to turn caching off.

  (3.2.0 2024-01-30
         "
# Changed

* Now action uses `bash -xeo pipefail` for running Roswell install script. This way, in case of some errors inside the script, it will be interrupted immediately.
* Also, we don't attempt to set `ROSWELL_INSTALL_DIR` env variable anymore, because despite it's presence, Roswell was installed into `/mingw64/bin/` instead under Windows and it works well (at least for me).
* Now we don't add action's directory to the `PATH` using modification of `GITHUB_PATH` variable. This prevents modification of the `PATH` of a workflow called the action.

# Fixed

* Fixed running of test.ros script under Windows.

")
  (3.1.0 2024-01-27
         "
# Changed

* Switched from Roswell v21.10.14.111 to v23.10.14.114.
* Now action checks if it is really installed requested Lisp implementation.
* A list of supported implementation was added to the documentation.
* Some implementation supported by Roswell, have problems. If you need them, please, contribute the fix either to this action or to the Roswell itself.

# Fixed

* Now all steps fail-fast on the first encountered error. Previously some step might be failed, but action's execution was considered success.
* Fixed Quicklisp fix activation for lisp implementations which are not support :HOME as part of the pathname.

         "# New

          - Add Windows support.

          # Breaking changes

          Now instead of latest version of ASDF, Roswell and Qlot
          we pin versions which known to work in supported environments.

          If you want latest version, pass \"latest\" as value of
          \"asdf-version\", \"roswell-version\" or \"qlot-version\".

          Currently these versions are used:

          - ASDF: 3.3.5.3
          - Roswell: v21.10.14.111
          - Qlot: 0.11.5

          Thanks for these changes to Matteo Landi!")
